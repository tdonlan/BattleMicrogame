2017-07-10 Plan / Notes

x-timer that moves a drag UI element
x-button - click and measure tiem with dragger

x-have downtime between clicks
x-translate the clickvalue to a percent to hit

-need a small buffer after slider complete (have some buffer room built into the SliderValue?) so you can click right at 100?
